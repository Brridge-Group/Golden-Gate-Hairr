React User Authentication Tutorial
==================================

## How to use this repository
First, you should plan to follow the instructions in the writeups. Here's the links to all parts for quick reference:
[Part 1 - Server Setup](https://coursework.vschool.io/token-auth-with-jwts-part-1/)

(After part one, the series splits into 2 branches - one that uses Redux for state management and another that uses React's native Context API instead.)

**Using React Context**
[Part 2 - React Setup - React + Context](https://coursework.vschool.io/token-auth-with-jwts-part-2-react-context/)
[Part 3 - Security and UX - React + Context](https://coursework.vschool.io/token-auth-with-jwts-part-3-react-context/)

**Using Redux**
[Part 2 - React Setup - React + Redux](https://coursework.vschool.io/token-auth-with-jwts-part-2-react-redux/)
[Part 3 - Security and UX - React + Redux](https://coursework.vschool.io/token-auth-with-jwts-part-3-react-redux/)

## Goals
The purpose of these tutorial series is to give you a taste of what it means to include token authentication in a project. It doesn't aim to teach basic principles of Node/Express, React, Redux, etc.

## Assumptions
The writeups listed above assume a basic understanding of JavaScript (ES6), promises, React, Node/Express, and either Redux or React Context, along with some other more advanced principles of React like Higher-Order Components.
